## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Learning geospatial SQL to find re-entrant corners in building footprints and why they matter for wildfire risk. It was
very interesting to learn how to do this fully in BigQuery. and also it was a good learning experience to go from
polygons -> vertices -> concave angles using bigquery SQL and geospatial functions.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Analyze aggregations of property data to detect patterns and normalize regional discrepancies. I want to aggregate
features (e.g., footprint area, corner metrics, age/materials) by region, apply normalization to
remove baseline regional effects, then compare pattern strength across regions.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

There isn't a lot of changes I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project. We've mainly been
learning and following mentor provided assignments, so there isn't a lot we can deviate from or uniquely code yet.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Using deep learning models like CNNs, transformers, etc... on footprints, or researching more deep learning models to
build models for Q2 project.

Using polars in Rust for faster data cleaning/joins, lazy pipelines, and aggregations on large property tables before
building a model.
